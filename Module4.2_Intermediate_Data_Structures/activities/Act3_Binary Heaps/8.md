Here is the solution in Python code:

```python
def topKFrequent(nums, k):

  ## Step 1: use dictionary to keep track of element frequencies
  d = dict()
  for num in nums:
    if num not in d.keys():
      d[num] = 1
    else:
      d[num] += 1

  ## Step 2: use binary heap to sort key-value pairs from dictionary
  heap = BinHeap()
  for key in d.keys():

    # we insert a tuple consisting of the negative of the element's frequency, followed by the element itself
    # we use the negative of the frequency because our heap is a MinHeap and so the lowest values will
    # bubble to the top; however these are actually the highest values, which is what we want
    heap.insert((-d[key], key))

  ## Step 3: Retrieve the k most frequent elements, which have been naturally sorted by our heap

  # create an empty list
  res = []

  # call delMin() k times
  for i in range(k):
    temp = heap.delMin()

    # add the 2nd element of each tuple to the list
    res.append(temp[1])

  # return the list containing the k most frequent elements
  return res
```

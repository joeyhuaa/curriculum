Now we are going to solve a coding problem:

### K Most Frequent Elements

**Given a non-empty array of integers, create a function that returns the k most frequent elements. Use a binary heap to solve this problem.**

##### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

##### Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

##### Hint:

Think about how to take advantage of the organizational structure of a Min Heap to solve this problem.

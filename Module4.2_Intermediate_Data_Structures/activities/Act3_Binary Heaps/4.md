To finish our discussion of binary heaps, we will look at a method to build an entire heap from a list of keys. The first method you might think of may be like the following. Given a list of keys, you could easily build a heap by inserting each key one at a time. Since you are starting with a list of one item, the list is sorted and you could use binary search to find the right position to insert the next key at a cost of approximately **𝑂(log𝑛)** operations. However, remember that inserting an item in the middle of the list may require **𝑂(𝑛)** operations to shift the rest of the list over to make room for the new key. Therefore, to insert 𝑛 keys into the heap would require a total of **𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)** operations. However, if we start with an entire list then we can build the whole heap in **𝑂(𝑛)** operations. Below shows the code to build the entire heap:

```python
def buildHeap(self,alist):
    i = len(alist) // 2
    self.currentSize = len(alist)
    self.heapList = [0] + alist[:]
    while (i > 0):
        self.percDown(i)
        i = i - 1
```

To visually interpret how the heap is built, with the above function, the below figure will depict how it is built:

>  Figure 4: Building a Heap from the List [9, 6, 5, 2, 3]

Figure 4 shows the swaps that the `buildHeap` method makes as it moves the nodes in an initial tree of [9, 6, 5, 2, 3] into their proper positions. 

Initial Heap: [9, 6, 5, 2, 3]
i = 2 : [9, 2, 5, 6, 3]
i = 1 : [2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
i = 0 : [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

The `percDown` method ensures that the largest child is always moved down the tree and check the next set of children farther down in the tree to ensure that it is pushed as low as it can go. 

In this case, initial list [9, 6, 5, 2, 3] turned to the list [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]. When **len(aList) = 5; i = len(aList) // 2, i = 2**, a number '2' at the lowest level of the tree swapped with the number '6'. When **i = 1**, the number '2' swapped with the number '9', because 2 is less than 9. Now, the number '2' is located in right position of the heap. The number '9' needed to swap to the lowest level of the tree after the comparison with the number '3'. It results in a swap with the number '3'. Now that the number '9' has been moved to the lowest level of the tree, no further swapping can be done. It is useful to compare the list representation of this series of swaps as shown in [Figure 4](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/Trees/BinaryHeapImplementation.html#fig-buildheap) with the tree representation.

The next method we will implement is `insert`. The easiest, and most efficient, way to add an item to a list is to simply append the item to the end of the list. The good news about appending is that it guarantees that we will maintain the complete tree property. The bad news about appending is that we will very likely violate the heap structure property. However, it is possible to write a method that will allow us to regain the heap structure property by comparing the newly added item with its parent. If the newly added item is less than its parent, then we can swap the item with its parent. The figure below shows the series of swaps needed to percolate the newly added item up to its proper position in the tree:

Notice that when we percolate an item up, we are restoring the heap property between the newly added item and the parent. We are also preserving the heap property for any siblings. Of course, **if the newly added item is very small, we may still need to swap it up another level**. In fact, **we may need to keep swapping until we get to the top of the tree while new item is smaller than its parent**. 

Below depicts the `percUp` method, which percolates a new item as far up in the tree as it needs to go to maintain the heap property. Figure 2 represents the MinHeap (the parent node is less than or equal to the children node) with `percUp` method. MaxHeap (the parent node is greater than or equal to the children node) can be used `percUp` method when the inserting number is greater than the parent node.  Here is where our wasted element in `heapList` is important. Notice that we can compute the parent of any node by using simple integer division. The parent of the current node can be computed by dividing the index of the current node by 2.

```python
def percUp(self,i):
    while i // 2 > 0:  "dividing the index of the current node(i) by 2"
      if self.heapList[i] < self.heapList[i // 2]:                                                                                   "if heapList[i] is less than heaplist[i//2] "
         tmp = self.heapList[i // 2] "tmp is equal to heapList[i//2]"
         self.heapList[i // 2] = self.heapList[i]"heapList[i//2] is equal to heapList[i]"
         self.heapList[i] = tmp "heapList[i] is equal to tmp"
      i = i // 2  "index of current node is equal to i//2 "
```



We are now ready to write the `insert` method (see below). Most of the work in the `insert` method is really done by `percUp`. Once a new item is appended to the tree, `percUp` takes over and positions the new item properly.

```python
def insert(self,k):
    self.heapList.append(k)
    self.currentSize = self.currentSize + 1
    self.percUp(self.currentSize)
```

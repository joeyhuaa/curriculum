With the `insert` method properly defined, we can now look at the `delMin` method. Since the heap property requires that the root of the tree be the smallest item in the tree, finding the minimum item is easy. The hard part of `delMin` is restoring full compliance with the heap structure and heap order properties after the root has been removed. We can restore our heap in two steps. First, we will restore the root item by taking the last item in the list and moving it to the root position. Moving the last item maintains our heap structure property. However, we have probably destroyed the heap order property of our binary heap. Second, we will restore the heap order property by pushing the new root node down the tree to its proper position. Below shows the series of swaps needed to move the new root node to its proper position in the heap:

In order to maintain the heap order property, all we need to do is swap the root with its smallest child less than the root. After the initial swap, we may repeat the swapping process with a node and its children until the node is swapped into a position on the tree where it is already less than both children. The code for percolating a node down the tree is found in the `percDown` and `minChild` methods as seen below:

```python
def percDown(self,i):
    while (i * 2) <= self.currentSize: "While index of current node times 2 is less than or eqaual to currentSize of heaplist"
        mc = self.minChild(i) "integer mc is equal to minChild"
        if self.heapList[i] > self.heapList[mc]: 
                                          "if heapList[i] is greater than heapList[mc]"
            tmp = self.heapList[i] "tmp is equal to heapList[i]"
            self.heapList[i] = self.heapList[mc] "heapList[i] is equal to heapList[mc]"
            self.heapList[mc] = tmp "heapList[mc] is equal to tmp"
        i = mc "index of current node is equal to mc"

def minChild(self,i):
    if i * 2 + 1 > self.currentSize:
        return i * 2
    else:
        if self.heapList[i*2] < self.heapList[i*2+1]:
            return i * 2
        else:
            return i * 2 + 1
```



The code for the `delmin` operation is defined below. Note that once again the hard work is handled by a helper function, in this case `percDown`.

```python
def delMin(self):
    retval = self.heapList[1]
    self.heapList[1] = self.heapList[self.currentSize]
    self.currentSize = self.currentSize - 1
    self.heapList.pop()
    self.percDown(1)
    return retval
```

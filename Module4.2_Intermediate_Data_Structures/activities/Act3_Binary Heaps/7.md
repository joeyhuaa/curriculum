The way to approach this problem is to look at it as a 3-step problem:

**Step 1:** Keep a count of each element in the list.
**Step 2:** Sort the result from Step 1.
**Step 3:** Determine the k most frequent elements.

In Step 1, we will loop through each element in the list and tally it onto a dictionary, using the elements as keys.

Step 2 is where we implement the Binary Heap. We will loop through each key-value pair in the dictionary we created in Step 1 and insert them one-by-one into a heap. We will use the `BinHeap` class and the `insert` method to do this. The `insert` method also calls `percUp` which sorts everything for us, making the final step super easy.

In Step 3, we simply call `delMin` k times and return the results in a list.
